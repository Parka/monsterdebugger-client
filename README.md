# Monster Debugger Client Library with Proxy support

This copy of the [Monster Debugger](http://www.demonsterdebugger.com) client library adds support for properties of the type Proxy. Right now you can't inspect the Proxy object but support for inspecting when possible could be added in the future.

This fork of the client library works with the official version of the Monster Debugger Adobe AIR application, completely unmodified, that can be downloaded from [demonsterdebugger.com](http://www.demonsterdebugger.com).

### How does it work?

Just the same as the regular Monster Debugger.

## What is Monster Debugger?

[Monster Debugger](http://www.demonsterdebugger.com) has been developed by Amsterdam based design studio [De Monsters](http://www.demonsters.com/) to assist in debugging applications created in Flash, Flex and AIR. With Monster Debugger you can:

* Trace various types of data that are present in your project and view them in a friendly way.
* Explore your live application
* Edit properties at runtime
* Run methods and get the results at runtime
* See detailed traces

Monster Debugger has been developed as an AIR application and thus runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. By adding an ActionScript class to your projects you are ready to start debugging your application using Monster Debugger.

[Josh Tynjala](http://twitter.com/joshtynjala) forked the client library to add support for Starling Framework and I used his config for seting up this project, but I used no source code form that project.
